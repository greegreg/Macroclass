##Project Description

This file will use R to extract data from FRED, manipulate the data, draw some pictures of the data. Do some statistical analysis of the data.

All of the macro data that I could possibly ever want is at FRED. Rather than download every file with R I'm going to create an excel file with the data that I want. I'll use R to extract the data from the excel file. Getting the data in a clean format will be easiest in this format.
